Each entry in the database is a “taxon”, also referred to as a “node” in the database. The “root node” (taxid1) is at the top of the hierarchy. 

The path from the root node to any other particular taxon in the database is called its “lineage”; the collection of all of the nodes beneath any particular taxon is called its “subtree”.
