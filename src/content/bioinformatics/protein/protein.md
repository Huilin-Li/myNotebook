Each amino acide is made of Carbon, Oxyden, Nitrogen, Hydrogen atoms. And some have sulfur atoms too.

These atoms form an <mark>Amino group (-NH2)</mark>, a <mark>Carboxyl group (-COOH)</mark> and a <mark>Side chain (-R)</mark>. These three groups are attached to a central carbon atom, called Alpha Carbon Î±-carbon.

These amino acids can be divided into three groups based on their properties determnined by their side chains:
- Hydrophobic: carbon-rich side chains which don't interact well with water.
- Hydrophilic/Polar: iteract well with water.
- Charged: iteract with oppositely charded amino acids or other molecules.

## Structure

### Primart structure
> Linear sequence of amino acids encoded by DNA

Amino acids are joined by peptide bonds, happending between -COOH and -NH2. A water H2O molecule is released each time a bond is formed.
