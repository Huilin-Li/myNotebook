# Paird t-Test

1. Dependent sample \\(t\\)-test.
2. It determineds whether the mean difference between two sets of observations is zero.
3. One should measure each subject/entity twice, resulting in pairs of observations.
4. Common application: Case-control studies, Repeat-measures desgins.
5. Two competing hypotheses:
    - Null hypothesis.
        - assumes that the true mean difference between the paired samples is zero.
        - all ovservanle differences are explained by random variation.
    - Alternative hypothesis.
        - assumes that the true mean difference between the paired samples is not equal to zero.
        - explained:
            - two-tailed: the true mean difference is not equal to zero.
            - one-tailed: 
                - upper-tailed alternative hypothesis: the true mean difference is greater than zero.
                - lower-tailed alternative hypothesis: the true mean difference is less than zero.

            

> ✅ 假设检验不是对你眼前这组数据下结论，而是试图推断产生这些数据的“背后机制”是什么。我们用数据去判断它更符合哪种假设：‘两组一样’还是‘有差异’。
